# Pokémon Game
This project is a simple, interactive game with the intention of catching as many pokemons as you can before you run out of Pokéballs. Once you have no Pokéballs left, the game ends.    
To play, simply click on any grass patch to reveal what's hidden beneath. Upon clicking, it will result in one of the three possible outcomes:
- A random Pokémon,
- Two additional Pokéballs, or
- Nothing.
  
As the game progresses, counters display the number of Pokéballs remaining and the total number of Pokémon caught. In addition, a table tracks how many of each Pokémon you've caught and a visual histogram dynamically updates to reflect the changes. 
In order to achieve this, the project utilized several HTML and CSS elements and Javascript:
- HTML was used to structure the game interface, including the layout of grass patches, counters, and the table.
- CSS was used to style the game visually, enhancing the layout and providing responsive feedfack like hover effects on the grass.
- JavaScript utilized the DOM elements in order to build gaming logic, including click events, random outcomes, updating counters, and dynamically modifying the table.
